Caffe Sales Prediction Project

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for predicting total sales in a coffee shop using transaction data. The project covers the following key steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and errors.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key trends, correlations, and distributions.
Feature Engineering: Extracting time-based features like day of the week and month.
Modeling: Building and evaluating a regression model with XGBoost to predict total sales.
Deployment: Saving and loading the trained model for future predictions.
The project aims to provide valuable business insights by predicting sales, helping optimize inventory and marketing strategies. The model's performance is assessed with evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
