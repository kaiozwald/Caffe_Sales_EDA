# Caffe Sales Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts coffee shop sales based on transaction data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and a machine learning model using XGBoost for sales prediction.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, removes errors, and preprocesses the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes sales trends, item popularity, and seasonal effects.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features such as transaction date insights.
- **Modeling**: Implements an XGBoost regression model to predict total sales.
- **Evaluation**: Uses MSE and RÂ² score to assess model performance.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaiozwald/caffe-sales-prediction.git
cd caffe-sales-prediction

```

## Usage
```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load model
with open('xgboost_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Prepare new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({...})

# Predict sales
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
```
